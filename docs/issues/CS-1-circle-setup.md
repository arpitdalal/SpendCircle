## Intent

A new Circle should be useful immediately. **Circle Setup** is a *skippable* onboarding step
that gathers optional context (what the Circle is for; for a residence, **Residence Type** —
leased ⇒ Rent, owned ⇒ Mortgage) and from it **derives starter Categories** (PRD 7, 8).
Shared defaults (Groceries, Dining, Transport, Utilities, Health,
Entertainment, Shopping, Education, Travel) are always useful; context adds the targeted ones.
A Personal Circle can be used before completing setup (glossary).

## Implement

- **Convex** (`circles.ts` or new `circle-setup.ts`):
  - `completeCircleSetup` mutation: args `{ circleId, answers }`. Flow:
    `requireCircleAccess` → Owner-only → `assertWritable()` → derive the starter Category
    set from `answers` (pure function in `packages/domain`, e.g.
    `starterCategories(answers): {name,type,color}[]`) → create each via the **same uniqueness
    path as CAT-1** (skip any that would collide) → persist setup answers on the Circle (add a
    `setupAnswers` field — needs a schema addition; record an ADR only if the shape is
    surprising) → `recordEvent` for setup completion + each derived Category create.
  - Setup is one-shot: once answers are persisted, `/setup` redirects to the Circle dashboard
    and the mutation rejects reruns so derived Category sets cannot be mixed.
- **Domain:** `starterCategories(answers)` — pure, fully unit-tested mapping from answers to
  the category list (residence leased→Rent, owned→Mortgage, plus shared defaults).
- **Web:** a skippable setup step after CS-0 create; optional questions; "skip" leaves the
  Circle usable with no categories.

## Why this way

- **Starter Categories go through the CAT-1 uniqueness path** so setup can't create
  duplicates or violate the per-type case-insensitive rule. Don't bulk-insert raw.
- **Derivation is a pure domain function** so the mapping is testable with zero mocks and
  shared if native ever needs it.
- Currency is selected during Circle creation; setup should not ask for it again.

## How to test

- **Domain:** `starterCategories` — leased residence includes Rent not Mortgage; owned
  includes Mortgage not Rent; non-residence excludes both; shared defaults always present;
  no duplicate names within the derived set.
- **Mutation:** Owner completes setup → categories created and events recorded; rerun ✗;
  non-owner ✗; archived Circle ✗; deriving a Category whose name already exists → skipped, no
  error; setup on a Circle with a Transaction → categories still derivable (non-colliding).
- **One-shot:** completed setup cannot be run again and cannot mix Trip/Residence starter sets.
- **Skip:** skipping creates no Categories and leaves the Circle usable.

## Done when

- Owner can run skippable setup that derives
  non-colliding starter Categories via the CAT-1 path; answers persist; completed setup
  cannot run again; pure derivation tested; gates pass.

## Out of scope

Editing color/mark (CS-2); the currency-lock enforcement mechanics (CS-3).
