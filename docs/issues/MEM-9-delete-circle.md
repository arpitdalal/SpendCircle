## Intent

Abandoned setup work shouldn't become permanent noise: an Owner can **delete** an active or
archived regular Circle with **no Transactions ever created and no current Member other than the
Owner**. A removed Member does not block deletion: without financial history, a mistaken shared setup is still
disposable. A current co-Member blocks deletion until removed, so deletion never unexpectedly
revokes active access. Deletion also revokes pending Invitations + invalidates links (PRD 22
applies to delete too). Circle Settings, Categories, and Circle History alone are disposable
setup artifacts and do not block deletion. A Personal Circle can never be deleted (glossary).

"No Transactions ever created" means none exist now — including archived ones — since archived
Transactions still represent history. "No current Member other than the Owner" means removed
member rows do not block deletion, while any active co-Member does.

## Current implementation

### Backend (`packages/convex/convex/circles.ts`)

- **`deleteCircle`** — owner-only; currently rejects Personal Circles, any additional membership
  row (including Removed Members), or any-transaction circles
  with coded `ConvexError`s; cascades members, categories, invitations, circle/category
  histories, and `e2eInvitationTokens`; retains `invitationEmailEvents` (ADR 0026 rate-limit
  ledger); no `recordEvent` (entity ceases to exist).
- **`circleHasTransactions`** — minimal boolean query for the settings UI gate (`null` when
  inaccessible).

### Domain (`packages/domain/src/mutation-errors.ts`)

- `circle.delete.forbidden`, `circle.delete.personal`, `circle.delete.hasMembers`,
  `circle.delete.notEmpty` — user-facing messages guide toward archive where appropriate.

### Web

- `useDeleteCircle` / `useCircleHasTransactions` in `app/lib/data/circles.ts`.
- Danger-zone **Delete circle** on `app/routes/circle/settings.tsx` — shown only for empty
  regular circles; archive guidance when history exists; confirm dialog; success → `/`.

## Decision gap

The server must count only active co-Members for delete eligibility, while still cascading all
member rows on deletion. The current settings gate already uses the active Member list and will
then agree with the mutation.

### Tests

- Convex: `packages/convex/convex/circles.test.ts` (`deleteCircle`, `circleHasTransactions`).
- Web: `apps/web-app/app/routes/circle/settings.test.tsx` (delete flow, coded errors, guidance).

## Done when

- Owner can delete only a regular Circle with no active co-Members and 0 Transactions any status,
  cascading every dependent row (members, categories, invitations, related histories, e2e tokens)
  while retaining the invitation rate-limit ledger; everything else refuses with a coded error toward
  archive; invite links die; caller lands on `/`; tests green; gates pass.

## Out of scope

Archiving non-empty Circles (MEM-8 — shipped separately); cleaning up `notifications` whose links
point at the deleted Circle.
