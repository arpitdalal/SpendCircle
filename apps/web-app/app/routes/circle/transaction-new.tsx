/**
 * The new-Transaction route — `/circles/:circleRef/transactions/new` (issue #96). A
 * dedicated create page so the ledger no longer stacks a create form above its rows,
 * mirroring `transaction-edit.tsx`'s lifecycle (the up-to-date object-route template).
 *
 * Own params (URL-view-state convention, ADR 0016):
 *   - `type=expense|income` (required) — the kind of Transaction to create. Missing /
 *     invalid is treated like an archived Circle: there is nothing safe to show, so the
 *     route ejects to the validated `returnTo` origin rather than guessing a type.
 *   - `month` — the create form's date default (`selectedMonth`), so opening the form
 *     from a navigated ledger month files the new row into THAT month. A missing /
 *     malformed month falls to the current month. This is the page's own create concern,
 *     distinct from `returnTo`.
 *
 * Close (cancel / successful save), the invalid-`type` guard, and the archived-Circle
 * redirect ALL land on the validated `returnTo` (issue #123): the exact filtered ledger
 * URL the CTA was opened FROM, or — when absent / malformed / out-of-scope — the Circle's
 * ledger (anti-enumeration). Unlike edit there is no target to resolve, so no resolver: a
 * create page has nothing to fetch by id. `closing` + `Splash` keep the form from
 * flashing while the close navigation is in flight, exactly as edit does.
