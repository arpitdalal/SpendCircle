/**
 * The new-Category route — `/circles/:circleRef/categories/new` (issue #96; revised #138).
 * A dedicated create page so the Categories list no longer renders a new-Category form
 * above its rows alongside per-row edit forms and history panels — the overload that issue
 * removed. Same static-segment + lifecycle pattern as `transaction-new.tsx`.
 *
 * Own param: `type=expense|income` is now an OPTIONAL initial default for the form's
 * in-form type toggle (issue #138), not a hard requirement. The list's All filter deep-links
 * no type (and you can't create an "all" category), and a filtered list deep-links its
 * concrete type. A missing / unrecognized `type` seeds `expense` — there's nothing to eject
 * over, since the toggle lets the user pick either type on the page.
 *
 * Close (cancel / successful save) and the archived-Circle redirect land on `returnTo` —
 * the categories list the CTA was opened FROM, with its type/status/search intact, or the
 * bare list when absent / malformed / out-of-scope. The server enforces writability anyway
 * (ADR 0015), but the page shouldn't offer a form every submit would reject. `closing` +
 * `Splash` keep the form from flashing while leaving.
