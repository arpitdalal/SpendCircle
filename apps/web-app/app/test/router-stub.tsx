 * `"loading"` purely while the destination route MODULE downloads. There is no API to
 * stall a chunk download on demand, so a deferred loader is the test instrument that
 * reproduces the IDENTICAL observable the layouts react to (`useNavigation().state ===
 * "loading"` with a pending `navigation.location`). The loader-driven path is never hit
