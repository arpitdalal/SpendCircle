/**
 * The Transaction object guard over the shared resolution primitive (ADR
 * 0016/0017), the second adapter the `useResolvedRef` state machine was extracted
 * for. It reads `transactionRef`, parses it, and subscribes to
 * `getEditableTransaction` scoped to the resolved Circle (from Outlet context) —
 * the edit target is fetched BY ID, never found in the visible ledger page, so an
 * off-month or off-page Transaction still opens (TXN-5).
 *
 * The server collapses missing / inaccessible / wrong-Circle / archived /
 * not-editable-by-viewer all to `null`, and this hands that `null` to the
 * primitive, which fires the generic unavailable-link snackbar and falls back to
 * the caller-supplied `fallback` — the validated `returnTo` origin the route
 * computed (issue #123), so closing an unavailable edit link returns the User to
 * where they opened it FROM (search, dashboard, ledger), or the Circle's
 * Transactions route when `returnTo` is absent/malformed. A stale title slug
 * canonicalizes in place via the primitive.
 *
 * The route always resolves `fallback` to a read-only-safe in-Circle path: an archived
 * Circle stays accessible, so its edit links land back on the return origin rather than
 * ejecting through the unavailable path. The origin may be the bare Circle root (a valid
 * `returnTo`) — still read-safe, since the dashboard renders read-only for an archived Circle.
 *
 * `enabled` lets the route stop resolving when it should not be showing the form at
 * all — skipping the query AND every effect (no fallback, no canonicalize), so the
 * route's own navigation always wins (see `transaction-edit.tsx`). Two cases need it:
 * a successful save that renames the Transaction changes its canonical ref, so a live
 * resolver would canonicalize the now-stale slug and race the close; and an archived
 * (read-only) Circle must drop the edit URL to the in-place ledger without ever taking
 * the generic unavailable-link path, even when the target itself resolves to `null`.
