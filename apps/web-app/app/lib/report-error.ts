/**
 * The single seam for reporting an application-level problem — something the app
 * itself got wrong and should fix, as distinct from an expected user or
 * permission outcome. Forwards to Sentry (ADR 0012); dev still warns locally.
 *
 * A missing or inaccessible target is NOT an app error and must never be reported
 * (it would be noise, and the anti-enumeration stance treats it as a normal
 * outcome — ADR 0016). Reserve this for things the app emitted wrong, such as an
 * unparseable in-app link. Never attach financial content (titles, notes, amounts)
 * to `context` — Sentry extras are scrubbed before send, but callers should still
 * avoid attaching financial fields.
