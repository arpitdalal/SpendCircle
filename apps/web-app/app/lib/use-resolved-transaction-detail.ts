/**
 * The Transaction DETAIL object guard over the shared resolution primitive (ADR
 * 0016/0017), the reference object adapter the `useResolvedRef` state machine was
 * extracted for. It reads `transactionRef`, parses it, and subscribes to
 * `getTransaction` scoped to the resolved Circle (from Outlet context) — the detail
 * target is fetched BY ID, so a Transaction outside the visible ledger page still opens.
 *
 * The sibling of {@link useResolvedTransaction} (which resolves the EDIT target via
 * `getEditableTransaction`): both parse the same ref the same way, but this one reads the
 * read-only detail query, so it resolves for ANY current Member and for an archived
 * (frozen) Transaction too — the server only collapses missing / inaccessible / wrong-
 * Circle to `null`. That `null` flows to the primitive, which fires the generic
 * unavailable-link snackbar and falls back to the Circle's Transactions route; a stale
 * title slug canonicalizes in place. There is no `enabled` gate: a detail surface has no
 * save-rename race or write-when-archived case to suppress, so resolution always runs.
