/**
 * The visual identity for a Member/User: their Profile Picture when present and
 * loadable, otherwise a generated initials avatar (CONTEXT: "if Google does not
 * provide one, Spend Circle uses a generated initials avatar"). The fallback also
 * fires when a present URL fails to LOAD (`onError`) — Google's profile-image
 * URLs can expire/403 over time, so an image prop being set is not a guarantee it
 * renders; without this a dead URL would show a broken image instead of initials.
 *
 * The generated chip — both the initials and its tint — is a pure function of the
 * Display Name, so it stays consistent for the same person across every Circle:
 * the materialized identity mirrors one Google profile onto all of a User's active
 * memberships (ADR 0018), and the client never needs the raw userId, which the
 * Member view deliberately withholds (ADR 0016). Colors are a cue, not identity,
 * so two people sharing a name (and thus a color) is fine.
 *
 * Purely decorative — `aria-hidden`, empty `alt` — because every surface that
 * renders it shows the Display Name in adjacent text; announcing the avatar too
 * would double-read the name.
