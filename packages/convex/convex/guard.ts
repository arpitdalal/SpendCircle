/**
 * The single Circle-access module (ADR 0015). Every Convex function that
 * operates on an existing Circle resolves identity, membership, and
 * capabilities through here instead of re-deriving them inline, so the
 * missing≡inaccessible rule (ADR 0016) and the read-only-when-archived rule each
 * have exactly one home.
 *
 * Two functions over one resolver:
 *   - `resolveCircleAccess` NEVER throws — a missing Circle, a non-member, a
 *     removed Member, and an unauthenticated caller all collapse to `null`. It
 *     feeds queries and the staged route guard (`circles.getCircle`).
 *   - `requireCircleAccess` is `resolve ?? throw` — the single home of the throw.
 *     It feeds mutations.
 * There is deliberately no `{ throwOnMissing }` flag: a boolean that flips the
 * error mode makes the return type conditional and callers get it wrong. Pick
 * resolve (null) or require (throw) at the call site.
 *
 * Boundary: this module is for operations on an EXISTING Circle. Circle-less
 * operations keep `requireCurrentUser` (auth.ts): `listMyCircles` (lists across
 * Circles), `createCircle` (no prior access), `users.setAnalyticsOptOut`.
 *
 * Capabilities here are Circle-level only (`isOwner`, `isWritable`). Entity-level
 * permission — a Transaction editable only by its Recorded By Member, a Category
 * by its creator, the Owner able to archive either — composes OVER this rather
 * than being inlined; the intended shape:
 *
 *   async function requireTransactionAccess(ctx, txnId) {
 *     const txn = await ctx.db.get(txnId)
 *     const access = await requireCircleAccess(ctx, txn.circleId)  // reuse, don't re-derive
 *     return { ...access, transaction: txn,
 *       isRecorder: txn.recordedByMemberId === access.membership._id,
 *       canArchive: txn.recordedByMemberId === access.membership._id || access.isOwner }
 *   }
 *
 * (`canModerate` is intentionally absent: it would be a synonym for `isOwner`
 * today — one adapter, a hypothetical seam — and is added only when a non-owner
 * moderation case actually appears.)
 *
 * Canonical mutating-handler shape (the pattern to copy):
 *   const access = await requireCircleAccess(ctx, circleId)
 *   access.assertWritable()                  // skip for read-only queries
 *   // ... perform the mutation ...
 *   await recordEvent(ctx, { entity, actor: access.membership, action, changes })

 * "is this the Recorded By Member?" inline (ADR 0015).
 *
 *   - `isRecorder` — the caller IS the Recorded By Member. It compares the
 *     Transaction's `recordedByMemberId` to the caller's RESOLVED `membership._id`,
 *     and since there is exactly one member row per (Circle, User) and rejoin
 *     reactivates that SAME row, a Removed→rejoined User naturally matches again
 *     and regains field-edit rights with no rejoin special-case (PRD stories 38,
 *     44). Only the Recorded By Member edits a Transaction's fields (TXN-2).
 *   - `canArchive` — Recorded By OR the Owner. The Owner moderates lifecycle
 *     (archive/restore — TXN-3) but may NOT edit another Member's fields, so the
 *     two capabilities are deliberately distinct.
 *
 * Anti-enumeration (ADR 0016): a missing Transaction and one whose Circle the
 * caller can't access collapse to the SAME "Transaction not found" throw, so
