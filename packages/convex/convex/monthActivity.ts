 * month-scoped report read the SAME active Transaction set for a Circle-month and

 * the active-only filter, and the totals math HERE means those surfaces can never
 * drift — one cannot start counting archived Transactions, range the month
 * differently, or sum totals another way while another does it right.
 *
 * The Convex queries (`ledger.getMonthlyLedger`, `dashboard.getDashboard`) stay thin
 * adapters: they resolve Circle access (guard.ts, ADR 0015), then read and reduce
 * through this module. This module performs NO access checks — it is reached only
 * after the caller has authorized the Circle — and reads only the `transactions`
 * table, so it stays a low-level leaf with no dependency on the query/view layer.

 * before the next month's prefix — letting a date-ordered index (`by_circle_status_date`)
 * range a month at the source instead of bucketing in memory (ADR 0009 dates;
 * README §4 index-backed reads). Shared by the month-scoped list, the Ledger totals,

 * Transactions are read: archived are frozen and excluded from reporting (TXN-3).
 *
 * The set is bounded to one month at the source: the unfiltered read ranges
 * `by_circle_status_date` to `[month, next-month)` active-only, and an optional Paid
 * By filter ranges `by_circle_paidby_status_date` so ONE Member's month is read at
 * the source rather than scanning the whole month and filtering in memory (README

 * optimization if a single month's volume ever warrants it, deferred for v1.
