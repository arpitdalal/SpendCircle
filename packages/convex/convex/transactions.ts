/**
 * Edits a Transaction's fields, including a Transaction Type Change (TXN-2; PRD
 * stories 29, 30, 38, 42, 44). Every arg is optional — an absent field is left
 * unchanged — and only the fields that actually change are patched and recorded,
 * so a no-op submit writes nothing and leaves no spurious history.
 *
 * Flow: `requireTransactionAccess` (folds in `requireCircleAccess`, ADR 0015) →
 * `assertWritable` (an archived Circle is read-only) → **Recorded By check**: only
 * the Member who recorded it may edit fields — the Owner moderates lifecycle
 * (archive/restore — TXN-3) but cannot rewrite another Member's fields → reject an
 * **archived Transaction** (frozen — PRD 40) → validate changed fields against the
 * shared Zod schema → resolve a changed Paid By to a current Member → resolve
 * Categories → patch + bump `updatedAt`, rewriting Category links only when they
 * changed → `recordEvent` with per-field `from`/`to` (ADR 0018).
 *
 * Type Change is special (PRD 29, 30): it CLEARS the existing Categories (Expense
 * and Income Categories must never mix) and so requires the caller to supply ≥1
 * active Category of the NEW type in the SAME operation, keeping the "≥1 Category
 * of the matching type" invariant unbroken mid-edit. It records `action:"type
 * changed"` with the type from/to and the categories cleared→added; a plain field
 * edit records `action:"edited"`.
 *
 * Anti-enumeration (ADR 0016): a missing Transaction and one whose Circle the
 * caller can't access both throw the same "Transaction not found".
