/**
 * The client-facing shape of one immutable history event — the read-side
 * counterpart of `history.ts`'s `recordEvent`, shared by every entity History
 * surface (Transaction History — TXN-4; Category History — CAT-2; Circle History
 * — CS-4). One definition so the surfaces can't drift and the web's shared
 * `HistoryList` renders all of them.
 *
 * The acting Member resolves to their frozen Display Name + image (memoized
 * through `cache` so a page of events touching the same actor reads the row once
 * — no N+1); a system event (no actor) surfaces `actor: null`. The `changes`
 * array passes straight through: it already holds frozen display-safe values
 * (text `from`/`to`, typed `fromMoney`/`toMoney`) and NEVER a raw id (ADR
 * 0018/0021). The Member id is deliberately dropped from the event — the UI
 * needs only the display identity, keeping raw IDs off the surface entirely
 * (PRD story 80).
