/**
 * TRUE-E2E (ADR 0019) regression guard for the sign-out wiring fixed in #132/#135.
 * Clicking Sign out runs the real `signOut` wrapper, and the user MUST end up signed
 * out at /signin — that holds via either path the fix defines, so we assert the
 * convergent outcome rather than which path fired:
 *   - success: the wrapper resolves, the session clears, and the reactive
 *     ProtectedLayout guard redirects (no bespoke routing); or
 *   - failure: the wrapper throws (it now surfaces Better Auth's resolved `{ error }`
 *     instead of swallowing it), and AccountMenu's catch logs + routes to /signin.
 * In this self-hosted cross-domain backend the sign-out fetch actually fails, so this
 * spec exercises the real #135 error path end to end — without the fix the user would
 * be stranded in the menu instead of landing here.
 *
 * Sign-out revokes the session, so this drives a throwaway user in its OWN anonymous
 * context rather than the per-worker `storageState`: tearing down that session can't
 * strand the other specs sharing the worker session. (Depending only on `browser`/
 * `baseURL` also means the worker auth fixture is never instantiated for this spec.)
