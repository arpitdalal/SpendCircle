# End-to-end tests

These are **true E2E** tests (ADR [0019](../docs/adr/0019-e2e-against-self-hosted-convex-backend.md)): the real
browser → real Convex functions → real database. They run against an **ephemeral,
self-hosted Convex backend** (the OSS `convex-backend` Docker image), not fixtures and
not a cloud deployment. The only fakes are Google OAuth (replaced by a flag-gated
email+password bypass) and outbound vendors (MSW).

## Auth: one User per Playwright worker

Specs import `test` / `expect` from [`fixtures.ts`](fixtures.ts), not `@playwright/test`
directly. A **worker-scoped** fixture signs up a fresh User (via `window.__scE2E`) once
per parallel worker and saves `storageState` to `e2e/.auth/worker-<index>.json`
(gitignored). That isolates Personal Circles across workers so list/total assertions do
not race; a stray `@playwright/test` import would drop back to an unsigned-in context
and is easy to miss in review.

## Running locally

`pnpm test:e2e` on its own only boots the **frontend** — it does **not** start the
Convex backend. With no backend on `127.0.0.1:3210`, the worker auth fixture fails with a
fetch / sign-in error.

Use the wrapper instead — it boots the backend, deploys, runs the suite, and tears
the backend down:

```sh
pnpm test:e2e:local                          # full run
pnpm test:e2e:local --headed                 # args pass through to `playwright test`
pnpm test:e2e:local e2e/transactions.spec.ts # a single spec
KEEP_BACKEND=1 pnpm test:e2e:local           # leave the backend up to debug
```

Requires Docker running. The script ([`scripts/e2e-local.sh`](../scripts/e2e-local.sh))
mirrors the CI **E2E** job ([`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`](../.github/workflows/e2e.yml))
step-for-step, so **when CI's E2E job goes red, reproduce it here** instead of pushing
speculative fixes. It reads the SHA-pinned backend image straight out of the workflow,
so it can't drift from CI.

## The `.env.local` gotcha

Your gitignored `packages/convex/.env.local` points the Convex CLI at the **cloud** dev
deployment. CI has no such file. The CLI refuses to deploy when `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` is
set alongside the self-hosted vars (*"CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT must not be set when
CONVEX_SELF_HOSTED_URL… are set"*). The script handles this by moving `.env.local` aside
for the deploy and restoring it on exit — so a hand-rolled `convex deploy` against the
local backend will fail where the script succeeds. Use the script.
